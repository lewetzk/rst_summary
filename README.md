# Project Summary: Automatic Text Summarization with the Strong Nuclearity Hypothesis

## Project Overview

This Python-based project investigated the conciseness of summaries generated using the Strong Nuclearity Hypothesis (SNH). Written as a mirror for a GitHub repository, the project compared SNH-generated summaries with alternative methods. Initially, Entity Coherence was used for evaluation, but due to summary brevity, text vectors from a RoBERTa model were employed as an alternative method.

## Evaluation Method

The project, titled "Automatische Textzusammenfassung mit der Strong Nuclearity Hypothesis," involved evaluating summaries using both Entity Coherence and text vectors from a RoBERTa model.

## Findings

Results showed that summaries generated using the SNH were only of mediocre quality. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, the SNH implementation, particularly for short comments from the PCC dataset, produced passable but not concise summaries.

## Future Considerations

Exploration of SNH-generated summaries for longer texts and/or English content could provide insights. Further adjustments to the SNH implementation might be necessary to enhance summarization performance.
